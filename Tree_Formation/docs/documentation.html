<p>Both the algorithms deal with the problem of drawing a tree by actually reducing it to allotting co-ordinates to the nodes of the tree by keeping in consideration the aesthetics for maintaining the tidiness of the tree and also the physical limits imposed by the environment used to draw the tree </p>
<strong>INPUT FORMAT:</strong><br/>
First line contains no. of nodes N.<br/>
N lines follow representing value of node to be inserted.<br/>
BST is built acc. to values of nodes, in order of input.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Algorithm WS : Tidy Trees</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong>This algorithm is used for tidy positioning of trees.It provides a non recursive approach to draw tidy trees in linear space and time complexity.The above algorithm does not create minimum width tree but provides an optimal tree following important aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>Algorithm WS satisfies the 3 aesthetics</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic 1</strong>:Nodes of a tree at the same height should lie along a straight line, and the straight lines defining the levels should be parallel. This is ensured by giving the y coordinate as 2*height+1</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic 2:</strong> In a binary tree, each left son should be positioned left of its father and each right son right of its father.This is done by providing appropriate coordinates to both childs of current parent according to the x coordinates available at their height before assigning x coordinates ofparent.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic3:</strong> A parent should be centered over its children.</p>
<p>This is implemented by using post order while assigning the x coordinate to the node. first both childs(if exist) are assigned x coordinates and then their parent is assigned.</p>
<p>This is done by using the following :if both child exists than x(parent)=x(right)+x(left)/2 ;</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), where n is number of nodes</p>
<p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong>O(n),where n is number of nodes</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;Algorithm TR : Tidier Trees</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>New Aesthetic</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Description: </strong>A subtree is drawn independently regardless of any other subtree in a tree, At any root, after left subtree and right subtree are drawn independently, each level of the shorter subtree is traversed and if nodes of two subtrees collide, their roots are pushed apart till they are well separated.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic 4:</strong> A tree and its mirror image should produce drawings that are reflections of one another; moreover, a sub-tree should be drawn the same way regardless of where it occurs in the tree</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), where n is number of nodes</p>
<p><strong>Space Complexity</strong>:O(n),where n is number of nodes</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Difference between algorithms due to Aesthetic 4</strong></span></h3>
<p><img src="p2_original.png" style="width:500px;height:350px;"><img src="p2_mirror.png" style="width:500px;height:350px;"> </p>
<p>Algorithm TR ensures that the drawing of mirror image of tree is actually it's mirror image because a subtree drawn will remain same regardless of its position in the tree <p>
<p><img src="p1_original.png" style="width:500px;height:350px;"><img src="p1_mirror.png" style="width:500px;height:350px;"> </p>
<p>Algorithm WS tries to give next closest available x coordinate to current node and thus does not ensure symmetricity and this algorithm shows a tree and its reflection whose drawings are not mirror images.  <p>

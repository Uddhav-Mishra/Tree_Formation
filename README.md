# Tree_Formation

**OVERVIEW :**

Both the algorithms deal with the problem of drawing a tree by actually reducing it to allotting co-ordinates to the nodes of the tree by keeping in consideration the aesthetics for maintaining the tidiness of the tree and also the physical limits imposed by the environment used to draw the tree

**REQUIREMENT**
C++ , OPENGL

**INPUT FORMAT:**

First line contains no. of nodes N.
N lines follow representing value of node to be inserted.
*BST is built acc. to values of nodes, in order of input.*

Algorithm WS : *Tidy Trees* and
Algorithm TR : *Tidier Trees*

**Description:**

These algorithms is used for *tidy and tidier positioning of trees*.
It provides a non recursive approach to draw trees in linear space and time complexity.
These algorithms does not create minimum width tree but provides an optimal tree following important aesthetics.

**OUTPUT:**

An optimal tree can be generated for any pattern provided in the input
